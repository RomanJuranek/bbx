    Resize all bounding boxes in bbs by ratio, keeping their center.
    Input:

    Output:
        np.ndarray with resized bounding boxes
    Raises:
        ValueError when wrong ratio is given

    There are different scenarios for various ratio inputs. When the ratio is
    scalar, all bounding boxes are resized by the same factor. In case of two
    scalars (tuple or array), all bbs are resized with different factor for width
    and height. Vector with length corresponding to the number of bbs, each bounding
    box is resized by its respective factor (same for width and height). The last
    case is when the ratio is matrix with two columns and rows corresponding to the
    number of bbs. Then each bb is resized by its respective factor different for
    width and height. In other cases, ValueError is raised.

    Example:
        bbs = [ [0,0,10,10], [10,10,10,10] ]
        bbx.resize(bbs, 2)      # [ [-5,-5,20,20],[5,5,20,20] ] - Just double the size of both
        bbx.resize(bbs, [1,2])  # [ [0,-5,10,20], [10,5,10,20] ] - Double the height
        bbx.resize(bbs, [[1,1],[2,2]])  # [ [0,0,10,10], [5,5,20,20] ] - Reisze only the second
